// Here you're initializing NextAuth.js with the authConfig object and exporting the auth property. 
// You're also using the matcher option from Proxy to specify that it should run on specific paths.

// The advantage of employing Proxy for this task is that the protected routes will not even start rendering 
// until the Proxy verifies the authentication, enhancing both the security and performance of your application.
